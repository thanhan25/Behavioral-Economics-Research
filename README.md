# Behavioral-Economics-Research
This repository is a small sample of the work done as a Research Assistant in Behavioral Economics at Columbia University and serves to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and visualization with Python.

This project involved evaluating complex data sets from behavioral experiments and creating visual model representations. The data from this project can not be made publically available, so I have shared a paper which contains graphs which I developed during this project.
