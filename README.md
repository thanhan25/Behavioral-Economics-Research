# Behavioral-Economics-Research
This repository is a small sample of the work done as a Research Assistant in Behavioral Economics at Columbia University and serves to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis and visualization with Python.

This project involved evaluating complex data sets from behavioral experiments and creating visual model representations. I can not make the data for this project publically available, so I have shared a paper which contains graphs which I developed during this project.
